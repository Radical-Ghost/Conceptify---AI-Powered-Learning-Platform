## 🚀 Features

-   **PDF/Image to Text**

    -   Native PDFs → Extracted using PyMuPDF
    -   Scanned PDFs/Images → OCR with Tesseract (future: PaddleOCR/LayoutLM)

-   **Structured Output**

    -   Headings, paragraphs, and lists preserved in JSON format
    -   Directly stored in DB for model-ready consumption

-   **Summarization**

    -   Use transformer models (LongT5, BART, Pegasus X) for clear, concise notes

-   **Question Generation**

    -   Auto-generate MCQs from content with adjustable difficulty

-   **Adaptive Learning Engine**
    -   Dynamic quizzes based on student performance
